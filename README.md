TC Cleaning Services

This website was developed following a Web Applications course at the University of the Pacific in 2023.
The project was to assist a small business with a new website. The site features a simple layout that
manipulates boxes, articles, tables and images using both HTML and CSS.

The future state would be to include PHP and Javascript to incorporate forms and features that gives 
life to the pages. Please continue to visit to view its progress.
